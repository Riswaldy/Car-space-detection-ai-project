    <p>With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles, parking has become a 
        major issue in many malls and tourist destinations. Searching for available 
        parking can take time, contributing to traffic congestion. Here, I propose a 
        modern solution to this problem by incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
        into the parking system. Parking managers can help motorists identify available 
        parking spaces. This project intends to use AI to speed up the parking 
        procedure, minimize congestion, and improve the parking system's efficiency.</p>
